<h1>About the project: </h1>

This is a web ai chatbot powered by google gemini. It has image processing features such as object detection, caption generation and image generation. 
Our primary goal for this project was to create a chabot which can analyze is environment with its image processing features.  
This project is a prototype.

This project is written using python language. <br>
We used flask to create this as a web application. As said, google's gemini api is used for the chatbot. You can replace the api key with your own api key.<br>
Mask-R-CNN model and COCO dataset is used for object detection, BLIP image captioning model is used for cpation generation for images and Stable diffusion model is used for image generation.
